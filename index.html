      //extra notes:
      //% is called the modulus uperator, checks for the remainder
      //difference between function var and const
      //what does the function key word do? prompts an event (javascript says I will do something)
      //what is var? holds some kind of data
      //ex: var num = 1
      // var string = "dog"
      //what is const? holds some kind of data, difference: we generally don't want to change this!
      //devs like to be articulate so if they use const they mean do not change it

      //difference between how you might create a function
      myFunction(); //not work
      myFunc(); //works
      //thus function only exists on this line and below
